                    <p>Our U19/Youth/Highschool rowing programs are for young athletes who want to grow through sport,
                        building strength, discipline, and confidence while learning the value of teamwork. With a focus
                        on skill development and fitness, the program prepares athletes for competition at the local,
                        regional, and national levels. For those with the drive to compete internationally, we provide
                        pathways and support to help them reach that stage as well. Whether you're new to rowing or
                        aiming to take your performance to the next level, our coaches create a supportive environment
                        that challenges each athlete to improve. Just as important, the program fosters a strong sense
                        of community where athletes form lasting friendships, learn to lead, and support each other on
                        and off the water.</p>

                <div class="writeup-container">
                    <p>Our U23 and Senior programs are designed for driven athletes who are pursuing high-performance
                        goals, including university rowing opportunities and selection to provincial or national teams.
                        With a focus on year-round development, the program provides a competitive training environment,
                        individualized coaching, and access to top-tier equipment. Athletes are challenged to reach
                        their full potential not only as rowers but as teammates and leaders. Alongside performance
                        goals, we emphasize personal growth, resilience, and the importance of community—creating a
                        culture where athletes support each other, push their limits, and grow both on and off the
                        water.</p>

                    <p>Our masters rowing program is built for adults who want to challenge themselves—whether through
                        competition or simply by staying active and connected through the sport. For those pursuing
                        racing, we offer structured training geared toward local and national regattas, with coaching
                        that supports both technical development and fitness. For recreational rowers, the focus is on
                        skill-building, staying fit, and enjoying time on the water in a relaxed, social environment.
                        Whether you're returning to rowing or discovering it later in life, our program fosters a
                        supportive atmosphere where teammates push each other to improve, share in each other's
                        successes, and build lasting friendships both on and off the water.</p>
