                    <p>The Ridley Graduate Boat Club has a rich history dating back to its establishment in 1972. Over
                        the decades, the club has grown from a small group of dedicated rowers to a thriving community
                        of athletes, coaches, and supporters. Our club has been home to numerous national and
                        international competitors, contributing significantly to the sport of rowing in Canada. The
                        club's location on Henley Island, the historic site of the Royal Canadian Henley Regatta,
                        connects us to over a century of rowing tradition. Throughout our history, we have maintained a
                        commitment to excellence in training, competition, and community building. Our alumni have gone
                        on to represent Canada at the highest levels of international competition, including the Olympic
                        Games and World Championships. The club continues to honor its founding principles while
                        adapting to the evolving needs of modern rowing.</p>

                    <p>Ridley Graduate Boat Club was formed in 1972 by legendary Canadian rowing coach <a
                            href="https://rowingcanada.org/hall-of-fame/neil-campbell/" target="_blank"
                            class="text-link">Neil Campbell</a>. After a successful rowing career which included
                        competing at the 1964 and 1968 Olympics, Campbell transitioned to coaching and became the head
                        coach of Ridley College in 1967. He would help lead the Ridley high school crews to numerous
                        CSSRA and American School Boy titles during his time at the school and by the time he formed the
                        Ridley Graduate Boat Club in 1972, was well on his way to becoming one of the leading rowing
                        coaches in Canada. The initial reason for creating the club was to support the aspirations of a
                        high performance rowing Campbell was coaching.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Shortly after the club was formed Campbell recruited another legendary coach to the club. <a
                            href="https://rowingcanada.org/hall-of-fame/jack-nicholson/" target="_blank"
                            class="text-link">Jack Nicholson</a> soon joined the Ridley coaching ranks and would go on
                        to have one of the most decorated careers in the history of Canadian rowing coaches at both the
                        club and national team level. Nicholson would coach at the national team level for over 20 years
                        and would coach at the Ridley Graduate Boat Club for an incredible 42 years. With Campbell and
                        Nicholson at the helm, Ridley's rowers were in good hands and were lucky to be able to learn
                        from such high level coaches. The early Ridley crews experienced a lot of the success, none more
                        than the 1984 eight who would go on to become one of the most famous in club history.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>For approximately 40 years <a href="https://www.rowontario.ca/nancy-storrs-hof/" target="_blank"
                            class="text-link">Nancy Storrs</a> brought her remarkable legacy to RGBC. A two-time
                        Olympian and World Championship medalist with the U.S. National Team, she became a driving force
                        in Canadian rowing after relocating to St. Catharines. Storrs led RGBC with distinction for
                        nearly four decades, mentored countless athletes, and contributed nationally as a coach, builder
                        of the masters rowing movement, announcer for the Royal Canadian Henley Regatta, and longtime
                        organizer of the Ontario Ergometer Championships, now renamed in her honour. Her leadership and
                        vision shaped not only RGBC but the entire rowing landscape in Canada.</p>
